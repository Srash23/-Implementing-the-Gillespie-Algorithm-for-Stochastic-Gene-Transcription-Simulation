This project implements the Gillespie algorithm to model the stochastic process of gene transcription into mRNA. Utilizing Python, the simulation captures the inherent randomness of mRNA production and degradation. By analyzing the temporal behavior of mRNA molecules, the study provides valuable insights into gene expression dynamics. Results highlight the fluctuations in mRNA levels, underscoring the importance of stochastic modeling in biological systems. This work serves as a crucial tool for researchers, offering a quantitative perspective on the complex interactions governing genetic expression.
